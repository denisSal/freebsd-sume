.Sh NAME
.Nm sume
.Nd "NetFPGA SUME 4x10Gb Ethernet driver"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines
in your kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device sume"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place
the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
if_sume_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for NetFPGA SUME Virtex-7 FPGA Development Board
with the reference NIC bitstream loaded onto it.
The HDL design for the reference NIC project uses the RIFFA based DMA
engine to communicate with the host machine over PCIe.
Every packet is transmitted to / from the board via a single DMA
transaction, taking up to two or three interrupts per one transaction
which yields low performance.
.Pp
There is no support for Jumbo frames as the hardware is capable of
dealing only with frames with maximum size of 1514 bytes.
The driver does not support multicast filtering.
.Pp
The hardware provides no checksums and offers no other offloading.
.Sh SYSCTL VARIABLES
The following variables are available as
.Xr sysctl 8
variables:
.Bl -tag -width "xxxxxx"
.It Va dev.sume.%d.rx_epkts
A 64-bit counter of the number of erroneous packets (wrong metadata or
too large packet) received on any interface.
.It Va dev.sume.%d.rx_ebytes
A 64-bit counter of the number of erroneous bytes (wrong metadata or too
large packet) received on any interface.
.It Va dev.sume.%d.debug
Debug information printing.
The default value is 0, set to 1 to enable.
.It Va dev.sume.%d.sume%d.ifc_down_packets
A 64-bit counter of the number of packets received on the interface
sume%d configured as down.
.It Va dev.sume.%d.sume%d.ifc_down_bytes
A 64-bit counter of the number of bytes received on the interface sume%d
configured as down.
.It Va dev.sume.%d.sume%d.hw_tx_packets
A 64-bit counter of the number of packets transmitted by the physical
interface sume%d.
This counter is updated in the timer function by fetching values from
the module register of the hardware interface.
.It Va dev.sume.%d.sume%d.hw_rx_packets
A 64-bit counter of the number of packets received on the physical
interface sume%d.
This counter is updated in the timer function by fetching values from
the module register of the hardware interface.
.It Va dev.sume.%d.sume%d.tx_packets
A 64-bit counter of the number of packets transmitted without error on
the interface sume%d.
.It Va dev.sume.%d.sume%d.tx_bytes
A 64-bit counter of the number of bytes transmitted without error on the
interface sume%d.
.It Va dev.sume.%d.sume%d.tx_dropped
A 64-bit counter of the number of packets dropped on TX to the interface
sume%d.
.It Va dev.sume.%d.sume%d.rx_packets
A 64-bit counter of the number of packets received without error on the
interface sume%d.
.It Va dev.sume.%d.sume%d.rx_bytes
A 64-bit counter of the number of bytes received without error on the
interface sume%d.
.It Va dev.sume.%d.sume%d.rx_dropped
A 64-bit counter of the number of packets dropped on RX from the
interface sume%d.

.Sh AUTHORS
The Linux
.Nm
driver was originally written by
.An -nosplit
.An Bjoern A. Zeeb .
The
.Fx version and this manual page were written by
.An Denis Salopek
as a GSoC project.
More information about the project can be found here:
.Pa https://wiki.freebsd.org/SummerOfCode2020Projects/NetFPGA_SUME_Driver
.Sh BUGS
The reference NIC hardware design cannot stop physical ports so
interfaces configured as DOWN have no effect on the board.
This means that the hardware forwards all the incoming traffic to the OS
and the driver needs to do the job of dropping the packets intended for
interfaces set as DOWN, thus consuming PCI / memory bandwidth,
interrupts and CPU cycles.
.Pp
Pre-built bitstream from the NetFPGA project may not work correctly - at
higher RX packet rates, the newly incoming packets would overwrite the
ones in some internal FIFO so the packets would come out of the board
scrambled until physical reset of the board.
.Pp
Sometimes, the driver can get stuck in a non-IDLE TX state but a
watchdog-like function is implemented to check whether a non-IDLE state
lasts for more then 3 seconds and it resets the board automatically.
